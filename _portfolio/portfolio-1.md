We experimented on methods to reduce the high computational power requirement of deep-learning based light field saliency detection algorithms and developed fast and accurate light field saliency detection algorithm with low computational complexity, leveraging on RGB saliency detectors. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art performance compared to light field saliency detection models in terms of speed with comparable and better Fβ values<br/><img src='/images/arch1.PNG' style='width:60%'>.
