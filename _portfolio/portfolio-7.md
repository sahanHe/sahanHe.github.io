title: "Analog Function Generator"
excerpt: "We developed a function generator device using analog circuits to generate given waveforms (sine, sawtooth, square, and triangular). Final device had the capability to produce the waveforms in the range 13-22800 Hz, with 0-20V amplitude and it was able to provide a current up to 0.2 A.. You can check the report and the datasheet [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zru50dc1lkl8vbk/AABYudRu5XwuaLHchDYl-AeUa?dl=0) and schematics [here](https://github.com/sahanHe/Analog-function-generator)."
